== Introduction

The purpose is to develop quickly a software development engineering tool base on different personal experiences.

As a personal choice the tool will be developped in C++. But techniques and used tools could be used in Java or C# environment.

The targeted OS is Windows.

There are two objectives of this project:

* Test some techniques, architecture, solutions, data structures.
* Get some useful tools to help in development process (all phases, project management included).

Wrappers of different tools normally used on Software Development process (but not only) will be created.

* Word
* Excel
* Outlook
* Notes
